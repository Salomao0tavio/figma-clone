# FigmaClone ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

## Introduction
Welcome to FigmaClone, a project aimed at replicating the functionalities of Figma while incorporating real-world features for enhanced collaboration. Inspired by [this instructive YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKIThIihv60), my goal is to improve my abilities in web technologies while building a practical and impactful application.

## Key Features
- **Live Collaboration**: Experience real-time collaboration by observing teammates' cursors and engaging in direct chat on the canvas.
- **Comments & Reactions**: Foster effective communication by leaving feedback, expressing reactions, and interacting with emojis.
- **Drawing Tools**: Unleash creativity with a variety of drawing tools, including shapes and image uploads, directly on the canvas.
- **Export to PDF**: Seamlessly export your designs to PDF format for easy sharing and printing.
- **Import Images**: Enhance your designs by importing images directly onto the canvas.
- **Chat Commands**: Write directly on the canvas using chat commands, initiated by pressing '/'.
- **Commenting & Emoji Reactions**: Leave comments and react with emojis, making collaboration engaging and interactive. Use 'E' to trigger emoji reactions.

## Technologies Utilized
- **Next.js 14**: Leveraging the latest advancements in Next.js for efficient and scalable development.
- **Fabric.js**: Employing Fabric.js to manage canvas operations, such as drawing shapes and handling objects.
- **Liveblocks**: Integrating Liveblocks to enable real-time collaboration features, ensuring synchronization across all users.
